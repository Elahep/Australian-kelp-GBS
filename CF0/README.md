Angela Mcgaughran sent me demultiplexed files of this very first sequencing run (DNA extracted by Catherine Suwignyo and libraries done by Rachel Rathjen).
I used *process_radtags* to further clear these samples and truncate the reads to 68 bp.

It appeared to me that all these samples belong to *D. potatorum*.

  *update*
  
  I realized the zip file that Angela sent me contained demultiplexed samples of both CF0 and CF1 runs. So I disgarded repetitive CF1 samples in this zip file and only used the CF0 samples. 
  In order to submit the raw reads to NCBI later, we can use the samples in this zip file.
  
  
  I do not have barcode file of this sequencing run. Angela or Crid can provide it if need be.
