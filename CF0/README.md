Angela Mcgaughran sent me demultiplexed files of this very first sequencing run (DNA extracted by Catherine Suwignyo and libraries done by Rachel Rathjen).
I used *process_radtags* to further clear these samples and truncate the reads to 68 bp.

It appeared to me that all these samples belong to *D. potatorum*.
